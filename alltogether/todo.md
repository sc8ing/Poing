### Qs for muller###

- this.[func] vs prototypes (startGame & move functions specifically)
- game core file as both module for server & use on client? (exporting)
  - load file for the module?

    â€‹

- order matters for update? balls first or paddles




*todo*


- make default options in the game core to avoid having them specified in both server and client code and making sure they match?
- default player positions
- putting keys in a record corresponding to what they mean (not just #s) in client code
