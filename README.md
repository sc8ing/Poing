# Pong
A four-player online pong game built using node, express, and socket.io.

## Setup:

1. Run `npm install` inside the package directory (installs express & socket.io dependencies)
2. Run `npm start` to start the game server on localhost on the default port (8175)
3. Point four browsers to `localhost:8175` and the game will start automatically. Use arrow keys to move back and forth.
