- "user experience"

  - remove scrolling ability from page
- update balls first or paddles?
- server stuff

  - number of players waiting for -> client
  - notify when user disconnects from game
- game.core.js

  - default player positions
  - add names
  - bouncing is kind of screwed up sometimes (hitting the side of a paddle should bounce off the screen)
  - movement relays don't move quite right (override socket event might be the only thing really keeping stuff synced up accurately)
    - this might not be true, but it's worth investigating
