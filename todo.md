### Qs for muller###

- order matters for update? balls first or paddles

  â€‹

  ## todo



- "user experience"

  - name bar looks kind of messed up when window's not huge
  - remove scrolling ability from page
- server stuff

  - fix having to type "/index.html"
  - number of players waiting for -> client
  - notify when user disconnects from game
- game.client.js

  - putting keys in a record corresponding to what they mean (not just #s) in client code
- game.core.js

  - default player positions
  - add names
  - bouncing is kind of screwed up sometimes
  - movement relays don't move quite right (override socket event might be the only thing really keeping stuff synced up accurately)
